<h3>0.15.0 (13/04/2020)</h3>
<p>
  Twenty-second alpha release.<br/>
  Feature
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Kept the completion's pop-up menu open after using the settings or filtering menu items.<br>
    This change makes using the completion's pop-up much easier, as you no longer have to
    reopen it each time, the plug-in will do it for you transparently.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Changes from 0.14.0</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Implemented a new Provider's filter type, which allow to "keep only selected" Provider</li>
  <li>
    Allowed changing completion type (Standard / Template) and Provider's filter type
    (Keep selected / Hide selected) from the completion pop-up's menu. No need to open Settings
    for that from now on! ;)
  </li>
  <li>For template completion, refactored the "No scope" element to behave better</li>
</ul>
